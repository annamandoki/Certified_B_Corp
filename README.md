# Certified B Corporations

## About the project

This is my personal course project for Data Analysis Fundamentals at ZHAW. The purpose of this project is to explore a dataset of choice and apply the data analysis techniques learned through the course. The dataset I chose for this project contains information on [certified B corporations](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/certification), companies that meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability.
