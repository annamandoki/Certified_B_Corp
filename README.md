# Certified B Corporations

## About the project

The purpose of this project is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and apply different data analysis techniques on the [Certified B Corps](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/certification) dataset, containing information on companies that meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability.

The [original notebook](https://github.com/annamandoki/Certified_B_Corp/blob/main/B_Corp_Project_Anna_M.ipynb) was my final course project for Data Analysis Fundamentals at ZHAW in April 2023. The [SQL script](https://github.com/annamandoki/Certified_B_Corp/blob/main/B_Corp_Best_for_the_World_2022_SQL.sql) has been added in May as a complementary analysis. I revisited the project in July 2023 in the [second notebook](https://github.com/annamandoki/Certified_B_Corp/blob/main/B_Corp_Project_July2023.ipynb), after the Q2 update of the dataset.
